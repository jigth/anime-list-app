# Anime List App

This is an application where I practiced some concepts of React (components and functions) by doing a CRUD app with the theme of animes. 

The aplication has a Backend made in **NodeJS+Express+MongoDB** and a Frontend made in **React**. 

It uses Environment variables to handle certain variables used by the system. Some are optionals (have default values), such as the PORTs of the aplication. Others are required, such as "REACT\_APP\_API\_URL" variable.


## Features

* Create animes (You can create other things such as movies or books if you provide the data).

* Delete animes

* Search animes (and see them updating in **real time** as you change your 'search query', A.K.A "The text that you search in the searchbar").

* Show the current ammount of displayed animes (look at the right corner of the header/navbar)


## What you could do with it.

* Use it to organize your own list of animes _If you know how to run it_ (or whatever you want: Books, Series, Cook Ingredients?)

* Use it as a base to make a CRUD APP in React (you should change some names according to your app domain but you don't have to).

* Use localhost or remote MongoDB database (MongoDB running in another server, MongoDBAtlas, any other Mongo SaaS such as the solutions provided by cloud providers).

* **You are free to use/modify this code** as much as you want in any way you desire.
